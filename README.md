Sail:onLagoon is a Laravel extension that simplifies the process of Lagoonizing Laravel sites 
that are already using Laravel Sail to generate their docker-compose setup.
This extension provides additional features and configurations tailored for Lagoon environments.

## Installation

The assumption is that you've already set up your Laravel development environment locally using [Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/sail). 

Once you have your Laravel site running locally, you can install `Sail on Lagoon` via composer:

```bash
composer require --dev uselagoon/sailonlagoon
```

Note that we install Sail:onLagoon as a dev dependency (with the `--dev` flag) as it simply creates and publishes
configuration files, therefore, the package itself isn't required at run time.

To use Sail:onLagoon, run the following Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan sail:onlagoon [--projectName=my-lagoon-project] [--no-interaction]
```

This will read your sail-generated docker-compose.yml file and attempt to generate the required files for a Lagoon installation.
You can, optionally, specify the name of your project and skip the interactive question.
Specifying `--no-interaction` will skip any interaction (including warnings) and Lagoonize the project.

## Requirements
There are very few requirements that aren't requirements for Sail directly, but they are:

- PHP >= 8.1
- Laravel >= 10

## Supported Services

Sail:onLagoon currently supports the following service types:

    MySQL
    PostgreSQL
    MariaDB
    Redis
    MeiliSearch

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
